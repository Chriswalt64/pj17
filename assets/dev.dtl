dev: Oh hey. Don't worry, Im not one of your irritating house guests. I'm actually Jayfever, one of the developers. Its Two and a hald hours before the jam ends and I'm wrapping things up. 
dev: I just wanted to put a message here and say that I reached out to my friends about being  interested in participating in the pirate jam over a month ago, and I thought making games could be a fun thing for us to do together. And they absolutely dove right in. I can't 100% speak for them, but I can say for me its been an absolute blast being able to create fun game jam games with them, and I think they feel the same.
dev: So I just wanted to pop this in here to as a little shout out to thank Xan, Chad2Underscores, Not_lazerprime, and Ayem. You guys are the coolest group of internet randos Dungeons & Dragons could have ever connected me with. And I hope we keep on hanging out or streaming or game dev-ing or TTRPG-ing or whatever together until the wheels come off!
dev: And players, I hope you have fun with our game!
MC: Thats awesome. But its time to leave my house, 4th wall breaking meta entity. 
dev: Gotcha. Oh, and speed runners you can skip me. Later!
